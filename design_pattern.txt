the robot is a real thing.
so the robot should be a class / object

the log server is a service / function / routine
so it should have an async function.
it may be a class.

So we have two objects.

if the log server is created globally
if the logger is created globally
if the robot is created globally

how can the robot and the log server acccess the logger?
via a file... - weird
via a global varibble - messy
via class attributes - good

we can pass in the instance, of what is needed.
