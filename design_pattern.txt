This robot is made of several types of processes.

There are mission critical processes (nearer hardware) and there are nice to have processes (database, logs server).

The nice to have, application type processes will be started from a script and will not depend or interfer with the mission critical proceses.

The mission critical processes will be started from a script and will only depened on other mission critical process.

The mission critical processes will be asyncio so that all the data is in the same thread.

The data will be output to redis from this thread.
