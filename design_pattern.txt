the robot is a real thing that executes functions.

so the robot is a class with attributes that can be shared across functions.

so the image functions can add images to the robot image queue and the image server can also grab those and send them

sets of functions are wrapped in modules 

modules are only sets of functions not classes

the functions can be always running functions as asyncio tasks / coroutines or simple sync functions
